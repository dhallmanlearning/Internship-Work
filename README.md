If you are a recruiter or hiring manager looking for the paper referenced in my resume, please go to PaperSubmission.pdf. I originally wrote the manuscript shortly after my 2016 internship, but I didn't get around to finalizing the work and submitting it until recently. The affiliation might throw you off - I wrote it while working at SPAWAR Systems Center Pacific, but the organization has since been renamed to Naval Information Warfare Center Pacific. I submitted the paper to the 2019 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Applied Electromagnetics on 7/8/19 and it is currently undergoing double-blind peer review. I will submit the paper to arXiv.org after I have received further notice on my submission.

The PDF titled Internship-Final-Report contains all the work I did during my 2016 internship. The paper I recently submitted came from the very last section of this report. The report was not submitted to any journals or conferences, so the IEEE copyright stated above does not apply to it.
