# Internship-Work
This repository contains all of my internship work.

If you are a recruiter or hiring manager looking for the paper referenced in my resume, navigate to dhallmanlearning/Internship-Work/Paper.pdf. I originally wrote the manuscript shortly after my 2016 internship, but I didn't get around to finalizing the work and submitting it until recently. I submitted the paper to the 2019 IEEE Asia-Pacific Conference on Applied Electromagnetics on 7/8/19 and it is currently undergoing double-blind peer review. I will submit the paper to arXiv.org after I have received further notice on my submission.

The PDF titled Internship-Final-Report contains all the work I did during my 2016 internship. The paper I recently submitted came from the very last section of Intership-Final-Report.pdf.
